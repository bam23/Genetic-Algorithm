## üìò Overview

This project explores two classic approaches to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** ‚Äî one of computer science‚Äôs most well-known NP-hard problems.  

The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.  

| Algorithm | Description | Complexity |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force** | Evaluates all permutations to guarantee the optimal path. | O(n!) |
| **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** | Uses evolutionary heuristics (selection, mutation, elitism) to approximate the best route efficiently. | O(n √ó g) |

Together, they highlight the trade-off between **accuracy** and **efficiency** in combinatorial optimization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Program Behavior

When you run the program, it performs the following steps:

1. Reads a square matrix of distances between cities from `cities.dat`.
2. Prints the full distance matrix for verification.
3. Executes the **Brute Force algorithm** and displays every route and cost.
4. Executes the **Genetic Algorithm**, evolving over multiple generations.
5. Displays the final optimal cost and runtime for both methods.

## üìÇ File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `graph.c / graph.h` | Handles graph initialization and distance matrix parsing. |
| `queue.c / queue.h` | Implements a heap-based priority queue for population management. |
| `function.c / function.h` | Contains both the brute-force and genetic algorithms plus helper functions. |
| `tester.c` | Entry point used by the instructor‚Äôs test harness. |
| `makefile` | Automates compilation and linking (`make`, `make clean`, `make run`). |

## üíæ Input Format (`cities.dat`)

Provide a symmetric distance matrix (N√óN) with zero diagonals.  
Example for **5 cities**:

```
0 29 20 21 16
29 0 15 17 28
20 15 0 28 39
21 17 28 0 13
16 28 39 13 0
```

## üßÆ Brute Force Algorithm

- Prints **every permutation** of city orders.
- Calculates and displays the **total travel cost** for each.
- Tracks and reports the **minimum cost path**.
- Execution time measured via `gettimeofday()`.

Example output excerpt:
```
|0||1||2||3||4||0|  Cost = 125.00  
|0||1||3||2||4||0|  Cost = 122.00  
...
Optimal Cost: 112.00
It took 1 second
```

## üß¨ Genetic Algorithm

The GA begins with a randomized population of possible tours and evolves them over multiple generations.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Key Features
- **Randomized initialization** (new each run)
- **User-controlled mutation rate** (number of cities swapped)
- **Elitism** (top performers survive)
- **Heap-based selection**
- **Optional fixed seed for reproducibility**

### üß† Runtime Parameters

| Prompt | Description | Typical Range |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| `How many generations to run?` | Total iterations of evolution | 10‚Äì50 |
| `Population size? (0‚Äì12)` | Number of candidate routes | 4‚Äì12 |
| `How many cities are you visiting? (0‚Äì19)` | Subset of cities | 4‚Äì10 |
| `Percentage of population to keep as elites?` | Controls elitism | 10‚Äì40 |
| `How many cities to swap on mutation?` | Mutation strength | 1‚Äì3 |

## üß∞ Enhancements & Safeguards

- ‚úÖ **Memory safety:** `memset` and `memcpy` corrected to avoid leaks  
- ‚úÖ **Symmetry validation:** ensures matrix consistency  
- ‚úÖ **Input validation:** clamps city and population values  
- ‚úÖ **Optional early-stop:** halts GA if no improvement over several generations  
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible runs:** use `srand(12345)` instead of `srand(time(NULL))`
